       The  mmdd  driver  provides virtual devices that are created
       from one or more  independant  underlying  devices.   This
       array  of devices often contains redundancy, and hence the
       acronym RAID which stands for a Redundant Array  of  Inde-
       pendant Devices.

       mmdd support RAID levels 1 (mirroring) 4 (striped array with
       parity device) and 5 (striped array with distributed  par-
       ity  information.   If  a  single  underlying device fails
       while using one of these level, they array  will  continue
       to function.

       mmdd  also  supports a number of pseudo RAID (non-redundant)
       configuations  including  RAID0  (striped  array),  LINEAR
       (catenated array) and MULTIPATH (a set of different inter-
       faces to the same device).

       With the exception of Legacy Arrays described below,  each
       device  that is incorportated into an MD array has a _s_u_p_e_r
       _b_l_o_c_k  written  towards  the  end  of  the  device.   This
       superblock  records  information  about  the structure and
       state of the array so that the array an  be  reliably  re-
       assembled after a shutdown.

       The  superblock  is  4K  long  and  is  written into a 64K
       aligned block that start at least 64K and less  than  128K
       from the end of the device (i.e. to get the address of the
       superblock round the size of the device down to a multiple
       of 64K and then subtract 64K).  The available size of each
       device is the ammount of space before the super block,  so
       between 64K and 128K is lost when a device in incorporated
       into an MD array.

       The superblock contains, among other things:

       LEVEL  The

       UUID   a 128 bit Universally Unique Identifier that  iden-
              tifies the array that this device is part of.

              A readable and writable file that reflects the cur-
              rent  goal rebuild speed for times when non-rebuild
              activity is current on an array.  The speed  is  in
              Kibibytes per second, and is a per-device rate, not
              a per-array rate (which means that  an  array  with
              more  disc  will  shuffle  more  data  for  a given
              speed).   The default is 100.
