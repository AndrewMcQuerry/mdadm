Subject:  ANNOUNCE: mdadm 1.7.0 - A tool for managing Soft RAID under Linux


I am pleased to announce the availability of 
   mdadm version 1.7.0
It is available at
   http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~neilb/source/mdadm/
and
   http://www.{countrycode}.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/raid/mdadm/

as a source tar-ball and (at the first site) as an SRPM, and as an RPM for i386.

mdadm is a tool for creating, managing and monitoring
device arrays using the "md" driver in Linux, also
known as Software RAID arrays.

Release 1.7.0 adds:
    -   Support "--grow --add" to add a device to a linear array, if the
        kernel supports it.  Not documented yet.
    -   Restore support for uclibc which was broken recently.
    -   Several improvements to the output of --detail, including
        reporting "resyncing" or "recovering" in the state.
    -   Close filedescriptor at end of --detail (exit would have closed it 
	anyway, so this isn't abig deal).
    -   Report "Sync checkpoint" in --examine output if appropriate.
    -   Add --update=resync for --assemble mode to for a resync when the
        array is assembled.	 
    -   Add support for "raid10", which is under development in 2.6.
	Not documented yet.
    -   --monitor now reads spare-group and spares info from config file
	even when names of arrays to scan are given on the command line

It is expected that the next full release of mdadm will be 2.0.0
and it will have substantially re-written handling for superblocks and
array creation.  In particular, it will be able to work with the new
superblock format (version 1) supported by 2.6.
Prior to that, some point releases (1.7.1, 1.7.2 ...) may be released 
so that the changes can be tested by interrested parties.

Development of mdadm is sponsored by CSE@UNSW: 
  The School of Computer Science and Engineering
at
  The University of New South Wales
