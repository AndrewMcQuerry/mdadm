Subject:  ANNOUNCE: mdadm 1.4.0 - A tools for managing Soft RAID under Linux


I am pleased to announce the availability of 
   mdadm version 1.4.0
It is available at
   http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~neilb/source/mdadm/
and
   http://www.{countrycode}.kernel.org/pub/utils/raid/mdadm/

as a source tar-ball and (at the first site) as an SRPM, and as an RPM for i386.

mdadm is a tool for creating, managing and monitoring
device arrays using the "md" driver in Linux, also
known as Software RAID arrays.

Release 1.4.0 adds:
    SparesMissing event in --monitor mode if a number of spares is declared
       in mdadm.conf, but that number of spares isn't found.
    --update=summaries option for --assemble mode to update some summary information
        in the superblock
    --test option for --detail to get a useful exit status.

Development of mdadm is sponsored by CSE@UNSW: 
  The School of Computer Science and Engineering
at
  The University of New South Wales
