       mmddaaddmm is a tool for  creating,  managing,  and  monitoring
       RAID devices using the mmdd driver in Linux.

       Some  common  tasks, such as assembling all arrays, can be
       simplified by describing the devices  and  array  in  this
       configuation file.


   SSYYNNTTAAXX
       The file should be seen as a collection of words separated
       by white space (space, tab, or newline).   Any  word  that
       beings with a hash sign (#) starts a comment and that word
       together with the remainder of the line are ignored.

       Any line that start with white space  (space  or  tab)  is
       treated  as  though it were a continuation of the previous
       line.

       Empty lines are ignored, but otherwise each (non continua-
       tion) line must start with a keyword as listed below.  The
       key words are case insensitve and can be abbreviated to  3
       characters.

       The keywords are:

       DDEEVVIICCEE A  ddeevviiccee  line lists the devices (whole devices or
              partitions) that might contain a component of an MD
              array.   When  looking  for  the  components  of an
              array, mmddaaddmm will scan these devices and no others.

              The  ddeevviiccee  line may contain a number of different
              devices (separated by spaces) and each device  name
              can contain wild cards as defined by gglloobb(7).

              Also,  there may be several device lines present in
              the file.

              For example:

              DEVICE /dev/hda* /dev/hdc*
              DEV    /dev/sd*
              DEVICE /dev/discs/disc*/disc


       AARRRRAAYY  The ARRAY lines identify actual arrays.  The second
              word  on  the line should be the name of the device
              where the array  is  normally  assembled,  such  as
              //ddeevv//mmdd11.   Subsequent words identify the array. If
              multiple identities are given, then the array  must
              match  ALL  identities  to  be  considered a match.
              Each identity word has a tag, and equals sign,  and
              some value.  The options are:


           uuuuiidd==  The value should be a 128 bit uuid in hexadeci-
                  mal, with punctuation interspersed if  desired.
                  This   must   match  the  uuid  stored  in  the
                  superblock.

           ssuuppeerr--mmiinnoorr==
                  The value is an  integer  which  indicates  the
                  minor  number that was stored in the superblock
                  when the array was created. When  an  array  is
                  created as /dev/mdX, then the minor number X is
                  stored.

           ddeevviicceess==
                  The value is a comma separated list  of  device
                  names.  Precisely these devices will be used to
                  assemble the  array.   Note  that  the  devices
                  listed  there  must  also be listed on a DEVICE
                  line.

           lleevveell== The value is a raid level.  This  is  not  nor-
                  mally  used  to  identify an array, but is sup-
                  ported so that the output of

                  mmddaaddmm ----eexxaammiinnee ----ssccaann

                  can be use directly in the configuration  file.

           ddiisskkss== The  value is the number of disks in a complete
                  active array.  As with lleevveell==  this  is  mainly
                  for compatibility with the output of

                  mmddaaddmm ----eexxaammiinnee ----ssccaann.
