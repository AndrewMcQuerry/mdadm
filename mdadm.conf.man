       mmddaaddmm is a tools for creating  an  managing  RAID  devices
       using the mmdd driver in Linux.

       Some  common  tasks, such as assembling all arrays, can be
       simplified by describing the devices  and  array  in  this
       configuations file.

       The file should be seen as a collection of words separated
       by white space (space, tab, or newline).   Any  word  that
       being  with a hash sign (#) starts a comment and that word
       together with the remainder of the line are ignored.

       Any line that start with white space  (space  or  tab)  is
       treated  as  though it were a continuation of the previous
       line.

       Empty lines are ignored, but otherwise each (non continua-
       tion) line must start with a keyword as listed below.  The
       key words are case insensitve and can be abbreviated to  3
       characters.

       The keywords are:

       DDEEVVIICCEE A  ddeevviiccee  line lists the devices (whole devices or
              partitions) that might contain a component of an MD
              array.   When  looking  for  the  components  of an
              array, mmddaaddmm will scan these devices and no others.

              The  ddeevviiccee  line may contain a number of different
              devices (separated by spaces) and each device  name
              can contain wild cards as defined by gglloobb(7).

              Also,  there may be several device lines present in
              the file.
