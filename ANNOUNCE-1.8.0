Subject:  ANNOUNCE: mdadm 1.8.0 - A tool for managing Soft RAID under Linux


I am pleased to announce the availability of 
   mdadm version 1.8.0
It is available at
   http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~neilb/source/mdadm/
and
   http://www.{countrycode}.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/raid/mdadm/

as a source tar-ball and (at the first site) as an SRPM, and as an RPM for i386.

mdadm is a tool for creating, managing and monitoring
device arrays using the "md" driver in Linux, also
known as Software RAID arrays.

Release 1.8.0 adds:
    -   --pid-file option to declare a file to record the pid in for 
	--monitor --daemonise
    -   Support for new "faulty" personalitiy (see md.4) - not submited to
        kernel.org yet.
    -   support for raid0 and linear over devices larger than 2 Terabytes.
    -   assorted bug fixes.

It is hoped that the next full release of mdadm will be 2.0.0
and it will have substantially re-written handling for superblocks and
array creation.  In particular, it will be able to work with the new
superblock format (version 1) supported by 2.6.
1.8.1 may be released soon which contains much of this functionality.

Development of mdadm is sponsored by CSE@UNSW: 
  The School of Computer Science and Engineering
at
  The University of New South Wales
