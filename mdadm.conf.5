.TH MDADM.CONF 5
.SH NAME
mdadm.conf \- configuration for management of Software Raid with mdadm
.SH SYNOPSIS
/etc/mdadm.conf
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B mdadm
is a tool for creating, managing, and monitoring RAID devices using the
.B md
driver in Linux.
.PP
Some common tasks, such as assembling all arrays, can be simplified
by describing the devices and arrays in this configuration file.

.SS SYNTAX
The file should be seen as a collection of words separated by white
space (space, tab, or newline).
Any word that beings with a hash sign (#) starts a comment and that
word together with the remainder of the line is ignored.

Any line that starts with white space (space or tab) is treated as
though it were a continuation of the previous line.

Empty lines are ignored, but otherwise each (non continuation) line
must start with a keyword as listed below.  The keywords are case
insensitive and can be abbreviated to 3 characters.

The keywords are:
.TP
.B DEVICE
A
.B device
line lists the devices (whole devices or partitions) that might contain
a component of an MD array.  When looking for the components of an
array,
.B mdadm
will scan these devices (or any devices listed on the command line).

The
.B device
line may contain a number of different devices (separated by spaces)
and each device name can contain wild cards as defined by
.BR glob (7).

Also, there may be several device lines present in the file.

For example:
.IP
DEVICE /dev/hda* /dev/hdc*
.br
DEV    /dev/sd*
.br
DEVICE /dev/discs/disc*/disc

.TP
.B ARRAY
The ARRAY lines identify actual arrays.  The second word on the line
should be the name of the device where the array is normally
assembled, such as
.BR  /dev/md1 .
Subsequent words identify the array, or identify the array as a member
of a group. If multiple identities are given,
then a component device must match ALL identities to be considered a
match.  Each identity word has a tag, and equals sign, and some value.
The tags are:

.RS 4
.TP
.B uuid=
The value should be a 128 bit uuid in hexadecimal, with punctuation
interspersed if desired.  This must match the uuid stored in the
superblock.
.TP
.B super-minor=
The value is an integer which indicates the minor number that was
stored in the superblock when the array was created. When an array is
created as /dev/mdX, then the minor number X is stored.
.TP
.B devices=
The value is a comma separated list of device names. Precisely these
devices will be used to assemble the array.  Note that the devices
listed there must also be listed on a DEVICE line.
.TP
.B level=
The value is a raid level.  This is not normally used to
identify an array, but is supported so that the output of

.B "mdadm --examine --scan"

can be use directly in the configuration file.
.TP
.B num-devices=
The value is the number of devices in a complete active array.  As with
.B level=
this is mainly for compatibility with the output of

.BR "mdadm --examine --scan" .

.TP
.B spare-group=
The value is a textual name for a group of arrays.  All arrays with
the same
.B spare-group
name are considered to be part of the same group.  The significance of
a group of arrays is that
.B mdadm
will, when monitoring the arrays, move a spare drive from one array in
a group to another array in that group if the first array had a failed
or missing drive but no spare.
.RE

.TP
.B MAILADDR
The
.B mailaddr
line gives an E-mail address that alerts should be
sent to when
.M mdadm
is running in
.B --monitor
mode (and was given the
.B --scan
option).  There should only be one
.B MAILADDR
line and it should have only one address.


.TP
.B PROGRAM
The
.B program
line gives the name of a program to be run when
.B "mdadm --monitor"
detects potentially interesting events on any of the arrays that it
is monitoring.  This program gets run with two or three arguments, they
being the Event, the md device, and possibly the related component
device.

There should only be one
.B program
line and it should be give only one program.

.SH EXAMPLE
DEVICE /dev/sd[bcdjkl]1
.br
DEVICE /dev/hda1 /dev/hdb1

# /dev/md0 is known by it's UID.

# /dev/md1 contains all devices with a minor number of

.br
ARRAY /dev/md1 superminor=1
.br
# /dev/md2 is made from precisey these two devices
.br

# /dev/md4 and /dev/md5 are a spare-group and spares
